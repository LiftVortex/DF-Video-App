Hi,

Thanks for giving this a shot!

Hopefully you've got all your videos in a folder, it'll pick up anything with a .mp4 extension as a video.
Once you've opened the application head to the settings tab and paste in your folder location.

If you have any .jpg or .png files in this folder it'll try its best to match it to the video (still a bit buggy),
as long as the thumbnail and video have more than 2/3 words in common then it should match it. The video names need to have
space in between the words for it to correctly parse (which seems to be default for DF videos) but the image file name can be seperated by any characters and it should still work fine.

To sort into catagories (DF Retro, Tech Focus etc) matching words of the catagory need to be in the title, it doesn't matter what position or order.
e.g. for a DF Retro video: "DF RETRO QUAKE.mp4" would work, this is also how it is named on the website.

If you are using the HVEC videos, you need to have the "Windows 10 + HEVC extensions" https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/p/hevc-video-extensions/9nmzlz57r3t7/0010

The videos are currently sorted by the "File Created" date, so they'll be ordered in the app as you downloaded them. Looking into doing this a better way.

If you have any feedback reach out to me on Discord @periapsis#0872 or email me at mail@liftvortex.com.

Thanks,
Nick
